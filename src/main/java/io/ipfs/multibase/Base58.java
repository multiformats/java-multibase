 * A custom form of base58 is used to encode BitCoin addresses. Note that this is not the same base58 as used by

 *
 * Satoshi says: why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?<p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and
 *    could be used to create visually identical looking account numbers.</li>
 * <li>A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account number.</li>
 * <li>E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.</li>
 * <li>Doubleclicking selects the whole number as one word if it's all alphanumeric.</li>
